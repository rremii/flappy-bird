Project for university exam, requirements:

-3D models that render like 2D

-No libraries

-The only web API I can use is drawing a point (I also used a filling API, but it was too slow. Anyway, it’s not necessary. I used it to make it look better.)

It’s an online game, but there can be only one session in the game (more sessions will probably lead to bugs). In order to play together, you can send a link to your friend. Also, the server may respond slowly the first time you buy it (it’s due to my free plan), and there may be some delay due to the server being far away. :D
